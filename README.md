Situation: Basic framework has been set up. All info added from Artist submission form. (Should be 30 total)  

Problem: 5 marker codes could not be added because marker location doesn't exist yet, as the marker hasn't been made.
This code has been stored in the "nomarkersyet-temp.html"

(Adding marker code with nonexisting markers stops the AR from working completely.)


1. Create missing markers (2 for Umber), 1 for Aidan, 1 for Shabad, 1 for Ruby.
2. Replace placeholder marker pattern URLs with appropriate ones.
3. Copy and paste the code according to instructions in the temporary file to the ar.html file.
4. Test!

Note:
There are 2 different types of Titles/Shadows/Names - 1 or 2

1 suffix is for artwork titles that fit on 1 line. (i.e. title1, shadow1, name1) 
2 suffix is for artwork titles that fit on 2 lines. (i.e. title2, shadow2, name2)

Shadow adds that black outline to make text easier to see.

2 different types of names to define size and location according to title size/location so no overlapping occurs.


This code has not been tested yet - no printer to test each of the markers. Please test and readjust position, size, word-count as needed.
