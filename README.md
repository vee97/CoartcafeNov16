Situation: Basic framework has been set up. All info added from Artist submission form. (Should be 30 total)  

Problem: 5 marker codes could not be added because marker location doesn't exist yet, as the marker hasn't been made.
This code has been stored in the "nomarkersyet-temp.html"


1. Create missing markers (2 for Umber), 1 for Aidan, 1 for Shabad, 1 for Ruby.
2. Replace placeholder marker pattern URLs with appropriate ones.
3. Copy and paste the code according to instructions in the temporary file to the ar.html file.
4. Test!
